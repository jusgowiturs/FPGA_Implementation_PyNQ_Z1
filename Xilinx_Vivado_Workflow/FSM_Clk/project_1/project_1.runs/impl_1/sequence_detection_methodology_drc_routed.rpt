2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_P_state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_P_state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst_n relative to clock(s) sysclk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on runindicate relative to clock(s) sysclk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_N_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_N_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_N_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_N_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
