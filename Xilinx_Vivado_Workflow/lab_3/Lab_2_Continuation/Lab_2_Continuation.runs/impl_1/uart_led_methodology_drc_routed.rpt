2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.500 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[1] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.533 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[0] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.709 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[2] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.855 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[3] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rxd_pin relative to clock(s) clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'led_pins[0]' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'led_pins[1]' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#3 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'led_pins[2]' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
